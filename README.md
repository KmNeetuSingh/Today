# React 
  React is  a javascript library is like your bestfriend when its time to building cool user interface for UI or web application. It's creation of facebook and loved by developer to build a cool interface for web applications and its  lets you create the  reuseable code
  snippet or it's also help to manage data in our webpage and the good things about its getting better with new feature.......
* History :-
React was crafted by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, and it was released internally in 2011 on the platform's newsfeed. Two years later, in 2013, React was made available as an open-source library. Its innovation lies in facilitating the creation of user interfaces with its component-based architecture, enabling efficient updates and rendering when data changes. This approach has made React highly esteemed among developers worldwide.

# Babel :-
Babel is like a language translator for JavaScript. It takes modern, advanced JavaScript code that might not work in all web browsers and converts it into a version that older browsers can understand. This way, developers can write code using the latest language features without worrying if it will work for all users. It's a tool that helps ensure code compatibility   across different browsers and environments, making developers' lives easier when building web applications.

* How it's work 
Babel specifically works with JavaScript, not HTML. It's like a translator for JavaScript code, converting newer versions of JavaScript into older ones so that they work on more web browsers. While it doesn't directly handle HTML, it's often used alongside other tools like webpack that manage different aspects of web development, including handling HTML files and bundling everything together to create a complete web application.

you can understand by this example like you want create
# Using Babel to Execute JSX in a Browser

Babel is a tool that helps convert modern JavaScript code into a format that older browsers can understand. It's particularly useful when working with frameworks like React, especially when using JSX syntax.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JSX Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script type="text/babel">
    const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
  </script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.8.4/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.8.4/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

like in this if we not use babel in script tag that we are not able to run this code in our browser..because of babel we are able to convert into the language in simple js that can our browser easily understand without confuse.


# React DOM

ReactDOM is a JavaScript library used with React to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model). It's specifically designed to render React components into the browser and manage their lifecycle.

Here's a simple example:

Let's say you have a React component named `App` that you want to render into the HTML document.

```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Define a simple component
const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
};

// Render the component into the DOM
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this example:

1. We define a simple React component `App` using JSX that renders a heading saying "Hello, React!".
2. `ReactDOM.render()` is used to render the `App` component into the HTML element with the `id` of `root`.

When this code runs, `ReactDOM.render()` takes the `App` component and injects its output into the HTML element with the ID of `root` in the document. This process effectively renders the component's content onto the web page.
# Package we need to work with React
So if you want to work with React you ahve to install these two package :- 
* React     import React from 'react';
* React Dom    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

# How do you add react to a web application?
Okay so there have lot of ways  but as beginner we have go in this way first we create a script tag i mean first we connected react library to our code then React Dom  after that we have to write our react code and after that we have write down our react code and once we done with it we will open it in our browser but before what you see that you are code is not execute is know why it is not execute it is happen you did not use babel in ur script so that's the reason your browser getting confuse so first we  ad babel in our code so that our browser not getting confused and it execute our code .. so simple  here is an example...............
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My React App</title>
  <!-- Include React and ReactDOM from CDN -->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.8.4/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.8.4/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <!-- Your React code will go here -->
</body>
</html>
* after that we write our react code 
<!-- ... (previous HTML) ... -->
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>

  <!-- React code -->
  <script type="text/babel">
    const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
  </script>
</body>

# React.createElement
React.createElement is a fundamental function in React used to create React elements. In simpler terms, it's a way to make elements in React using JavaScript.

When you write JSX in React (like <h1>Hello</h1>), behind the scenes, React converts this JSX code into React.createElement calls.

// JSX
const element = <h1>Hello</h1>;

// React.createElement equivalent
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello');

<!--  -->
# Three property that a createElement accept
React.createElement accepts three properties:

Type: Defines the type of element to be created. It can be an HTML tag name (like 'div', 'span', etc.) or a reference to a React component.

Props: (Optional) Represents the properties or attributes you want to assign to the element. This is an object that contains information like className, id, or other custom attributes.

Children: (Optional) Denotes the content nested inside the element. It can include other elements, text, or components that you want to place within the created element.

In simpler terms, React.createElement needs to know what type of element you want (like a div or a custom component), any properties you want to give it (like styling or custom data), and any content you want to place inside it. This function is used to create the blueprint for elements in React, allowing them to be rendered onto the screen.

# Meaning of Render and Root
* Render: In the context of React, "render" refers to the process of converting React components or elements into actual HTML elements that can be displayed on the screen. It takes the virtual representation of components created in React and turns them into visible elements that users can see and interact with in the web browser.

 * Root: In React, "root" typically refers to the HTML element where the React application gets mounted or inserted into the DOM (Document Object Model). It's the entry point for your React app. When you call ReactDOM.render() in React, you specify the React component you want to render and the DOM element where it should be rendered. This DOM element, often referred to as the "root" element, acts as the container for your entire React application within the HTML document.
